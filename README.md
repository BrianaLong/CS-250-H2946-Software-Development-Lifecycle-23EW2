How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To interpret the user's needs and impliment themm into the program I must create and follow the user stories. The stories give a solid guidlines to follow for the iterations of the project. The agile aproach highly values the clients involvement to make changes for the product. I will incoperate this into my future development work because it will allow me to have consistant communication with the client to ensure success. This will also allow consistant communication with other team members to address and questions and concerns.
